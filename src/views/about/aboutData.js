            `You can call me a software enginner, web designer, coder or any other title that fits in that bucket.  I have been dabling in tech my whole life, from building 
        spreadsheet formulas to assist in grading and record keeping, to fully embracing a 1 to 1 classroom enviornment (every student has a device), to turning a hobby
        of casual coding into a career.`,
        `I have never been one to think of who I am by what I have done, but more what I want to do. I belive that skills can be taught. New languages, frameworks, technologies
        are all a new challenge that gives me the opportunity to continually learn.  I prefer to keep learning, keep challenging myself, and do something that matters.`,
        `I am easily inspired.  I bring passion to any project I work on and meet 'new' with open arms. I am always looking for ways to improve, both myself and the projects 
        I work on. I get excited about the prospect of improving, building upon, making better whatever it is I touch.`,
        `I am a fast learner, eager to pick up on new skills. I don't see asks as impossibles, more a question of how much time and energy are we willing to spend on this.  I 
        like to understand how everything works together and the why behind what I do.`,
        `If you have an idea you want flushed out, someone to team up with to bring ideas to reality, a desire to make the world a better place, reach out.  I'd love to 
        hear from you.`
